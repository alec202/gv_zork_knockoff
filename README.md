# gv_zork_knockoff
 This is a text based game, idea was from the zork game.
 
 In order for the game class to work correctly, both the items_npc.py and locations_zork files are needed. These two files hold the three classes Item, NPC, and Location, and these classes are needed in order to allow the game class to run correctly.
